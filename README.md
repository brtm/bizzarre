# BiZZarre

BiZZarre is a collaborative SWOT canvas tool. It is a clone of [Trellis](https://github.com/automerge/trellis), which is built on top of [MPL](https://github.com/automerge/mpl), a distributed persistence library that allows developers to build collaborative applications that are realtime, offline, and network partition tolerant.
